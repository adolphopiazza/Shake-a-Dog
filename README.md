# Shake a Dog

Just shake your app to get a dog image!

<img src="screenshoots/ss1.png" height="300"><img src="screenshoots/ss2.png" height="300"><img src="screenshoots/ss3.png" height="300">

I'm using two libraries:

* Lottie for the running dog animation, when loading new image
* SDWebImage to load images

This is a simple project just to learn how to detect the shake gesture, it's really simple, we only need to call motionBegan on our ViewController.
